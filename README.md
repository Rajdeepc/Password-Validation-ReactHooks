## Password Validation with React Hooks

This project is made with React JS Hooks to demonstrate a password validation logic which validates three different kinds of validations:

 - Passwords must include one increasing straight of at least three letters, like abc , cde , fgh , and so on, up to xyz . They cannot skip letters; acd doesn't count.<br>
 - Passwords may not contain the letters i, O, or l, as these letters can be mistaken for other characters and are therefore confusing.
 - Passwords must contain at least two non-overlapping pairs of letters, like aa, bb, or cc. <br>
 - Passwords cannot be longer than 32 characters.        
 - Passwords can only contain lower case alphabetic characters.
